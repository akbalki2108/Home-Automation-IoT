# Home-Automation-IoT

## Description
This project is a Home Automation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It allows homeowners to control various home functions and devices remotely using a web interface and an Android app. The system is implemented using an ESP32 microcontroller as the core controller, which communicates with connected devices and sensors. The project aims to provide convenience, energy-saving, enhanced security, better accessibility, and personalization to users.

## Features
- Remote control of home devices and sensors via web interface and Android app.
- Energy-saving through efficient control of lights, temperature, and appliances.
- Enhanced security with features like motion sensors, security cameras, and smart doors.
- Better accessibility for people with disabilities through easy device control.
- Personalization of settings to suit individual needs and lifestyles.
- Data insights on energy consumption and usage to make informed decisions.

## Technologies
- ESP32 microcontroller as the core controller.
- Web interface for remote control through a web browser.
- Android app for remote control through a mobile device.
- Wi-Fi network infrastructure for communication between devices and interfaces.
